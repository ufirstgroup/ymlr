## [5.0.0] - 2023-11-03

Although this release contains only fixes but as the encoding changes, we
consider it a breaking change. Hence the major bump.

- handle empty list - [#163](https://github.com/ufirstgroup/ymlr/pull/163)

## [4.2.0] - 2023-08-18

### Added

- Adds an option `sort_maps` to encode map with entries sorted - [#139](https://github.com/ufirstgroup/ymlr/issues/139),[#144](https://github.com/ufirstgroup/ymlr/pull/144)
- Quote values beginning with `:{` - [#140](https://github.com/ufirstgroup/ymlr/issues/140),[#141](https://github.com/ufirstgroup/ymlr/pull/141)

## [4.1.0] - 2023-04-23

### Added

- `Ymlr.Encoder` - Option `except: :defaults` to exclude default values

## [4.0.0] - 2023-04-16

### Breaking Change

**Up to and including version 3.x, `ymlr` would encode structs out of the box.
This version introduces protocols so and structs need to `@derive Ymlr.Encoder`
in order to be encoded. See the documentation of the `Ymlr.Encoder` protocol
for further information.**

### Changed

- A protocol based implementation was added which give more freedom to users of this library - [#118](https://github.com/ufirstgroup/ymlr/pull/118)

### Added

- Adds an option `atoms` to encode atom map keys with a leading colon.
- Tuples are now encoded as lists.

## [3.0.1] - 2022-09-05

### Fixed

- Wrap map keys in doouble quotes when required ([#94](https://github.com/ufirstgroup/ymlr/issues/94), [#95](https://github.com/ufirstgroup/ymlr/pull/95))
- Encode structs by turning them to lists before mapping over them

## [3.0.0] - 2022-08-07

**In this release we changed the way `DateTime` is encoded (see below). This can be a breaking change if you rely on the old date format with spaces. Because of this change, version 3.0.0 is now again compatible with Elixir 1.10**

### Changed

- use `Enum.map_join/3` indead of `Enum.map/2` and `Enum.join/2` as it's more efficient according to credo recommendations
- Change the serialization of timestamps to use the canonical (iso8601) format, i.e. before: `2022-07-31 14:48:48.000000000 Z` and now: `"2022-07-31T14:48:48Z"` ([#87](https://github.com/ufirstgroup/ymlr/issues/87), [#90](https://github.com/ufirstgroup/ymlr/pull/90))
